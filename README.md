# üì¶ Task Processing API

This is a backend application built with **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **RabbitMQ** that simulates job processing with delay, retry logic, and failure handling. The API allows users to create tasks, which are then processed asynchronously with concurrency support.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

üí° Note: This is a Dockerized project. Make sure you have Docker installed before proceeding.

1. Create `.env` file from `.env.example`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> ‚öôÔ∏è You can control how many tasks are processed concurrently using the `RABBITMQ_CONCURRENCY` value in the .env file.

2. Start the services with docker

```bash
docker-compose up
```
